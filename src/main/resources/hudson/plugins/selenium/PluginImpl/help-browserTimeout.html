<div>
    Starting from selenium v2.21.0
    <br/>Controls how long the browser is allowed to hang (value in <b>seconds</b>)
    <br/>
    The grid does not act on this value by itself, but passes the value on to the nodes, which do.
    Should be higher than the socket lock timeout (45 seconds) and generally higher than values used in
    webDriver.manage().timeouts()
